# Mixed Messages
This is a Mixed Messages project from the Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineering course.

## Overview
This is the very first project using only JavaScript to practice language basics. For this project, I have built a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. I could take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make the program truly random, the final message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. This program outputs three different inspirational messages from three different people.

## Project Objectives:
* Build a message generator program using JavaScript
* Use Git version control
* Use command line
